Let's start by opening a new ticket. After creating the ticket, we need to enter certain information, including an email address, full name, phone number (optional), and a Help Topic. As a reminder, we created several Help Topics in our previous lab, so let's choose "Password Reset." Once selected, we should provide a detailed summary of our issue, such as "Experiencing multiple failed login attempts." After filling in the required details, we can press the "Submit" button, and this completes the intake process.

Next, we need to log in as one of our agents to view our tickets. Let's use Jane Doe, whom we created in our previous lab, as an example. Once logged in, we can proceed to assign the ticket. Normally, this task would be handled by a queue manager, but for this lab, Jane, our system admin, can fulfill this role. Let's navigate to the "Priority" section, where we can set the priority level. The priority can range from low, which typically indicates a relatively low focus, to Emergency, meaning the issue needs to be fixed as soon as possible or if it has the potential to cause serious harm to the business. For our ticket, let's set the priority to normal. Then, we can scroll down and leave notes on how the issue was resolved, any reassignments, and any other pertinent information that would assist in completing the ticket.

Finally, after entering all the necessary notes and resolving the issue, we can change the Ticket Status to "Resolved" and proceed to close out the ticket. Congratulations! Over the past few labs, we have successfully installed all the prerequisites, configured them, and even explored the lifecycle of a ticket. Well done!
